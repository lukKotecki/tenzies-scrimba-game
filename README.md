New Color-Tenzies game!
This is a Color-Tenzies game. My personal modification to simpler Tenzies game. I provide original game on the master branch.

Rules:
Click each color dice to freeze it at its current state. You need to remember freezed dices and click Roll until all dices are frozen at the same state/color. You can unfreeze a dice by click on it.
Remember each click! GL & HF
